All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and each skill is versioned independently in its `SKILL.md` metadata.

## [Unreleased]

### context-budget

- Added the `context-budget` skill (0.1.0) with `ctxcheck`, built on the `ctxlib` package.
  - It reads Claude Code and Codex CLI sessions.
  - It derives per-role handoff gates (coordinator, worker, planner) from the
    window.
  - It exits 3 when the runtime can't be measured.
  - Codex usage is `last_token_usage.total_tokens`, which matches the
    TUI.
  - The Claude window comes from env and model rules.
  - Includes a stdlib `unittest` suite under `tests/`.
- Added OpenCode (v1 and v2) and Pi backends to `ctxcheck`.
  - OpenCode reads `opencode.db` read-only. On v2 it skips usage before the
    last completed compaction. On v1, which sets no session id, it uses the
    newest session for the cwd. The window comes from OpenCode's models.dev
    data, then a preset.
  - Pi walks the session tree from the leaf and ignores abandoned branches,
    pre-compaction usage, and aborted or errored replies. The window comes
    from Pi's model files or OpenCode's models.dev data. If neither has it,
    ctxcheck exits 3 and asks for `--window` or `CTXCHECK_WINDOW`.
  - A resolving session id now beats a runtime that is only flagged as
    present (`OPENCODE=1`, `PI_CODING_AGENT`).
  - Added `references/runtimes.md` with the support matrix.
- Added a status-line sidecar for Copilot CLI, Antigravity and Cursor CLI,
  which keep their context count in memory only.
  - `ctxcheck statusline-tee --runtime R [-- cmd]` saves each status-line
    payload as an atomic snapshot. It then runs the original command and
    passes its output and exit code through, even when saving the snapshot
    fails.
  - `ctxcheck install-statusline cursor|copilot|antigravity
    [--dry-run|--uninstall]` wraps the runtime's status-line command. It
    edits only that one value, makes a timestamped backup, and is
    idempotent. `--uninstall` puts the original back.
  - Readers report `stale_seconds` and `measure_source: statusline`. They
    refuse snapshots older than 15 minutes (exit 3).
